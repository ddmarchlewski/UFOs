# UFOs
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to make a UFO sighting page by using bootsrap and Javascript. 

## Results
When you open the HTML file, you will be first see opening page with a background image at the top. The image of the opening page is shown below.

When you scroll down from here, you can see there are 5 different filters to select from: date, city, state, country, and shape. Once you choose your filter, click on the blue button on the bottom to update the page and see your results. You can also apply more than one filter to make your search more specific. The filter search page is shown below.

For example, if I wanted to see all sightings in the city of Benton, I can type Benton into the city filter search bar. Then, I click on the blue botton on the bottom to update the page to show the data in Benton.

## Summary
This page allows anyone to search through all the data within the data set by using the search bars. However, one major drawback is conforming if these sightings were true. I suggest showing how many people were at the site. Another suggestion is to add another search bar and have it search by length. One final suggestion is to update the page with more recent sightings.
